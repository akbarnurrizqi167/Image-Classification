# Image-Classification_DicodingSubmission
Project Final: Image Classification
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the final project of the Image Classification course. Throughout this course, I've delved into the fundamentals of machine learning and gained insights into the workings of neural networks. This repository houses my submission, a TensorFlow-based artificial neural network program capable of recognizing hand gestures representing scissors, rock, or paper.
